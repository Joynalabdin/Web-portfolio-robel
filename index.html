            <h3>Web developer guideline</h3>
            <P>Learning about web development is kind of like drinking from a fire hose. Google “coding,” and you’ve
                turned
                the hose on full blast. This guide serves as a slow drip to get you acquainted with and intrigued by the
                world of web development. It’s by no means a comprehensive manual.
            </P>

            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p>Once you’re clear on what web developer skills to learn and how to become a web developer, it’s time to start actually learning those skills. Does this mean going back to school for a new four-year degree in computer science? No! While you can definitely pick up skills like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a classroom setting, you can also learn them from your own home and at your own pace</p>

            <p>The goal of the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program is to equip learners with the unique skills they need to build database-backed APIs and web applications. A graduate of this program will be able to design and build databases for software applications, create and deploy database-backed web APIs, and secure and manage user authentication and access control for an application backend. Students will also learn how to deploy a Flask-based web application to the cloud using Docker and Kubernetes.</p>

            <p>A post-it note with this question written on it has been sitting on my desk for a couple of weeks. At first, I didn’t know how to approach such a question—I wanted to develop an answer that made sense to anyone new to the arena of web development, but that still touched upon the finer details. After all, maybe you are someone interested in making a career change and have repeatedly seen the words full-stack web developer on every technical educational website and job application. Or maybe you are simply curious as to why this phrase has been trending higher than bathing suits this summer.</p>
